You are a cloud security expert analyzing AWS IAM relationships.
Below is a list of relationships extracted from AWS resources in Neo4j.

Analyze these relationships and classify them into security risks:
- Privilege Escalation (e.g., IAM PassRole, AssumeRole)
- Credential Theft (e.g., GetAccessKey, EC2 Metadata exposure)
- Data Exfiltration (e.g., S3 Bucket permissions)
- Service Exploits (e.g., Lambda, EC2 SSRF)

Format output as JSON: 
[{{
    "from": "IAMUser1",
    "to": "IAMRole1",
    "relationship": "iam_pass_role",
    "attack_vector": "Privilege Escalation"
}}]

Data:
{json.dumps(relationships, indent=4)}

Return only the JSON array with classified attack paths.
